
Program : Write a Python program that computes the net amount of a bank account based a transaction log from console input. The transaction log format is shown as following:
D 100 W 200 (Withdrawal is not allowed if balance is going negative. Write functions for withdrawal and deposit) D means deposit while W means withdrawal.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
D 300,D 300,W 200,D 100.Then, the output should be: 500

def deposit(num):

    balance=balance+num
    
def withdrawal(num):
    global balance
    if(balance > 0):
        balance=balance-num
    else:
        print("Withdraw not possible because balance is less.")

balance=0
while True:
    data=input("Please enter the transaction details : ")
    if('Exit'==data):
        break

    elif(var[0]=='W'):
        withdrawal(int(var[1]))

Please enter the transaction details : D 300
Please enter the transaction details : D 300
Please enter the transaction details : W 200
Please enter the transaction details : D 100
Please enter the transaction details : Exit
Transactions are : 
[['D', '300'], ['D', '300'], ['W', '200'], ['D', '100']]
Balance =  500
